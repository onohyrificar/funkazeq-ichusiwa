A thrilling epic of duty, magic and vampyres set in the Third Age that looks at why Lord Drakan invaded Hallowvale. Sure to delight RuneScape fans old and new, this stunning tale shows how and why Hallowvale was taken over.
 
 The vampyres are coming.
 
 As the God Wars grind towards their brutal conclusion, the armies of darkness descend upon the city of Hallowvale - vampyres, werewolves, and legions of cruel mortal warriors, led by Lord Drakan. The streets are filled with panic, but Queen Efaritay remains confident. Surely Saradomin, Lord of the Light, will save them? Their military will stand strong, the glow of the Everlight will stave off the vyre and, if all else fails, the Queen has a secret weapon.
 
 Can the knightly warriors defending Hallowvale stand firm, or will they be undone not by the wicked efforts of their foe, but by the faltering reign of their queen, Efaritay? And why has Drakan become obsessed with claiming Hallowvale for himself?
 
 Faced with desperate choices, the queen adopts a risky strategy to turn the tide. Her choices will echo for eternity as the fate of Hallowvale teeters on the brink.

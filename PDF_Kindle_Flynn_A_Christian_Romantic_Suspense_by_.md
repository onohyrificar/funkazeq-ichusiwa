Overview
From USA Today Bestselling Author Laura Scott! Oath of Honor - To protect and serve... Protecting the witness... After witnessing a horrific double homicide, nanny Taylor Templeton calls Flynn Ryerson, the only cop she knows. Despite their personality differences, she trusts Flynn to keep her safe. And when gunfire rings out a mere three hours after the murders, it&#039;s clear the killer intends to eliminate her as a loose end. Flynn is determined to protect Taylor from harm, but the relentless attacks make it clear someone within law enforcement is providing inside information. They struggle to stay one step ahead of the killer and from being distracted by the attraction between them. They desperately need to identify the person responsible before it&#039;s too late.

Overview
Presenting the true stories of three core individuals in Titanic‚Äôs history - Captain Edward J. Smith, shipbuilder Thomas Andrews, and White Star Line chairman Joseph Bruce Ismay
 
 Titanic literature is full of misconceptions about the actions and motives of key individuals involved. When George Behe set out to write a book thoroughly documenting the activities of the Titanic‚Äôs Captain Edward J. Smith during his vessel‚Äôs maiden voyage, he soon realized that Smith‚Äôs activities were intimately intertwined with those of two other ‚Äútop officials‚Äù in the Titanic story ‚Äì shipbuilder Thomas Andrews and White Star Line chairman Joseph Bruce Ismay. With that being the case, he expanded his coverage to include all three men ‚Äì men whose post-disaster reputations differ from each other as greatly as night differs from day.
 
 This gripping study examines exactly what each of these three pivotal figures in Titanic‚Äôs story said and did across Titanic‚Äôs doomed maiden voyage, culminating in their vastly differing fates, cross referencing all the various survivor accounts and correcting many false impressions and muddled ideas along the way.

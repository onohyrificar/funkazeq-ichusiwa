Overview
Crying in H-Mart meets My Sister, the Serial Killer in this feminist psychological horror about the making of a female serial killer from a Korean-American perspective.
 
 Ji-wonâ€™s life tumbles into disarray in the wake of her Appaâ€™s extramarital affair and subsequent departure. Her mother, distraught. Her younger sister, hurt and confused. Her college freshman grades, failing. Her dreams, horrifyingâ€¦ yet enticing.
 
 In them, Ji-won walks through bloody rooms full of eyes. Succulent blue eyes. Salivatingly blue eyes. Eyes the same shape and shade as Georgeâ€™s, who is Ummaâ€™s obnoxious new boyfriend. George has already overstayed his welcome in her familyâ€™s claustrophobic apartment. He brags about his puffed-up consulting job, ogles Asian waitresses while dining out, and acts condescending toward Ji-won and her sister as if he deserves all of Ummaâ€™s fawning adoration. No, George doesnâ€™t deserve anything from her family. Ji-won will make sure of that.
 
 For no matter how many victims accumulate around her campus or how many people she must deceive and manipulate, Ji-wonâ€™s hunger and her rage deserve to be sated.
 
 A brilliantly inventive, subversive novel about a young woman unraveling, Monika Kimâ€™s The Eyes Are the Best Part is a story of a family falling apart and trying to find their way back to each other, marking a bold new voice in horror that will leave readers mesmerized and craving more.

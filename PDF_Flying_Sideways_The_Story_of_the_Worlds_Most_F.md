Overview
In his gripping, surprising, and wildly entertaining new memoir, Fred North tells the incredible true story of how he became the most famous film stunt helicopter pilot in the world.¬† As a young, misunderstood boy, Fred North was never a fan of the rules. Then, on an unremarkable day in 1969, a helicopter touched down in his hometown of Saint-Louis, Senegal, and turned his world upside down. Fifty years later, he‚Äôs Hollywood‚Äôs go-to stunt pilot with a world altitude record and over two hundred film credits to his name, including Inception, James Bond: Spectre, and Fast X. But a lot of incredible things happened in between. Flying Sideways tells the thrilling but heartfelt story of how a misfit boy with nothing but a dream breaks the rules, beats the odds, and learns to bet on himself. Against a vibrant global backdrop that touches down everywhere from New York City to Mongolia to Madagascar, we follow Fred as he deserts the French Army (in roller skates), talks his way into flight school, becomes chief pilot for the world&#039;s greatest rally car and adventures races, gets mixed up with DEA in Miami, dodges death (many times), and‚Äîperhaps most improbably‚Äîfalls in love. Flying Sideways is a nonstop thrill ride, reminding us that the most dangerous thing we can do with life is give up on it. Praise for Flying Sideways: ‚ÄúFlying Sideways is a captivating memoir, one that covers its author&#039;s personal and professional journey to the top of his game and the heights of our industry. In a voice that is as authentic and straightforward as Fred himself, this book hooks you in from its very first pages, sharing compelling details and nuance as it chronicles Fred‚Äôs unlikely and inspiring path to becoming one of the best there‚Äôs ever been.‚Äù ‚ÄîShawn Levy, Director and Producer (Night of the Museum, Strangers Things, Free Guy, The Adam Project) ‚ÄúFred North is the best . . . stunt helicopter pilot on the planet. If you want the impossible shot for your film, call Fred. Fred‚Äôs book is laced with the same casual cool and pulse-quickening adrenaline as his world class flying. A heartfelt account of a man in search of himself finding meaning in the impossible and a home in the sky.‚Äù¬† ‚ÄîSam Hargrave, Director (Extraction 2) Flying Sideways reminds us to always follow our destiny and live life at full throttle. While we wait to find our own true north this book inspires us by journeying with Fred as he finds his North.‚Äù ‚ÄîGerard Butler, Actor and Producer (London Has Fallen, Greenland, Kandahar)

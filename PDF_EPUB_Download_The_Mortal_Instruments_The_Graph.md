Overview
The seventh installment of the graphic novel adaptation of Cassandra Clareâ€™s bestselling The Mortal Instruments! Approached by subjugates of the Manhattan clan, Simon is surprised when he follows them to a meeting not with Raphael but with Camille Belcourt, former head of the New York vampires. Wrongfully exiled by her successorâ€”she saysâ€”Camille begs for Simonâ€™s aid in reclaiming leadership on the promise of helping him master his powers. The Mark of Cain protects Simon from any real physical danger, but the same canâ€™t be said for those he cares about. Can the ancient vampire be trusted by the new one? The thrilling saga continues with gorgeous illustrations by artist Cassandra Jean, as well as an interlude with the band written exclusively for the graphic novel!
